# Flutter Trivia

Cross-platform mobile application made with Flutter. It's a Trivia app made using the OpenTDB API
(Trivia Database, which contains questions based on different topics and answers \[both multiple-choice
and true-false\]. It's still a WIP.)

The purpose of the application is purely educational. The application implements:

1. The new **provider** package demonstrated at Google I/O 2019 (State Management). I believe Flutter's state management is still immature and _provider_ is a step into the right direction; BLoC just wasn't for me
2. REST API Calls using **http** package (to the OpenTDB API)
